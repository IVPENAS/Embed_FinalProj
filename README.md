<p align = "justify"> Due to our interest about animals specifically Cats and Dogs, allowed us to create a custom dataset to our Classifier utilized on Convolutional Neural Network learning model which is designed to distinguish using [number of ssize] pictures between the mentioned animals. The Classfier starts by inputting a image into the network which it'll be processed through multiple layers of convolutional filters allowing to distinguish patterns and features present in the inputted image, in which the network will gradually determine the different characteristics of a cat and dog including [1] ears, [2] tail, [3] snout, or [4] eyes which by then inputed to the fully conncted layers consolidating the informmation and making predictions about the image's class. By modifying the weights and biases of its network based on the discrepancies between predicted and real labels throughout the training phase will result an improvement upon the classifier. The model can iteratively adjust its parameters through a method called backpropagation to increase its accuracy over time. Once the model was trained

Once trained, the cat and dog classifier may be used with any image as input and output a probability score indicating whether the image contains a cat or a dog. For instance, the model classifies a picture as a cat if the output probability for "cat" is higher than the one for "dog," and vice versa.


Once the training is complete, the cat and dog classifier can take any given image as input and output a probability score indicating the likelihood of the image depicting a cat or a dog. For instance, if the output probability for "cat" is higher than the one for "dog," the model classifies the image as a cat, and vice versa.

The use of CNN learning in this classifier enables it to capture intricate visual details, robustly handling variations in pose, lighting, and background. It has proven to be highly effective in differentiating between cats and dogs, demonstrating its usefulness in various applications, such as animal shelters, veterinary clinics, or even automated pet surveillance systems.</p>
