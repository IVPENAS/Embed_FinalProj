<p align = "justify"> The cat and dog classifier using CNN learning is a machine learning model designed to accurately distinguish between images of cats and dogs. It leverages the power of Convolutional Neural Networks, a specialized type of neural network architecture that excels at extracting meaningful features from visual data.</p>

The classifier begins by inputting an image into the network. The image is then processed through multiple layers of convolutional filters, which detect various patterns and features present in the image. These filters capture low-level features like edges and textures, gradually progressing to higher-level features like shapes and object parts.

As the image passes through the convolutional layers, the network learns to recognize distinguishing characteristics of cats and dogs, such as the shape of their ears, snout, or tail. These learned features are then fed into fully connected layers, which consolidate the information and make predictions about the image's class.

During the training phase, the classifier learns by adjusting the weights and biases of its network based on the differences between predicted and actual labels. This process, known as backpropagation, allows the model to iteratively fine-tune its parameters to improve its accuracy over time.

Once the training is complete, the cat and dog classifier can take any given image as input and output a probability score indicating the likelihood of the image depicting a cat or a dog. For instance, if the output probability for "cat" is higher than the one for "dog," the model classifies the image as a cat, and vice versa.

The use of CNN learning in this classifier enables it to capture intricate visual details, robustly handling variations in pose, lighting, and background. It has proven to be highly effective in differentiating between cats and dogs, demonstrating its usefulness in various applications, such as animal shelters, veterinary clinics, or even automated pet surveillance systems.</p>
